## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-27

- TAG: [v1.0.1][1.0.1t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 86/86 lines in 4 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 28/28 branches in 4 files
- 12.50% documented

### Added

- Improved documentation of ENV variables and overrides in README.md

### Changed

- Retemplated with the current kettle-jem template set.

### Fixed

- (dev) Updated the development dependency floor to `kettle-dev` 2.0.1 so the
  templated `yard` rake task installs the expected yard-timekeeper cleanup.
- (dev) Routed `bin/yard` through `bin/rake yard` so direct documentation runs use the
  same rake-installed documentation plugin hooks.
- (dev) Restored templated Rake task loading so `bin/rake` runs the expected
  development task set instead of only the default stub.
- (dev) Restored full line and branch coverage for the public resolver and installer
  behavior.
